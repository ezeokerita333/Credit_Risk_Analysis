# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was predict credit risk using various models which includes oversampling data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, undersampling data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, using a combination approach of both over and undersampling data using the SMOTEENN algorithm. We also used two new machine learning models that reduces bias, called the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and the EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.


## Results
1. RandomOverSampler; - balanced accuracy scores: 0.65
                      - precision: low risk(0): 0.01 and high risk(1): 1.0
                      - recall scores: low risk(0): 0.72 and high risk(1): 0.59
                      
2. SMOTE Oversampling; - balanced accuracy scores: 0.65
                       - precision: low risk(0): 0.01 and high risk(1): 1.0
                       - recall scores: low risk(0): 0.63 and high risk(1): 0.69
                                          
3. ClusterCentroids algorithm; - balanced accuracy scores: 0.66
                               - precision: low risk(0): 0.01 and high risk(1): 1.0
                               - recall scores: low risk(0): 0.63 and high risk(1): 0.69
                      
4. SMOTEENN algorithm; - balanced accuracy scores: 0.66
                       - precision: low risk(0): 0.01 and high risk(1): 1.0
                       - recall scores: low risk(0): 0.72 and high risk(1): 0.57
                      
5. BalancedRandomForestClassifier; - balanced accuracy scores:
                                   - precision: low risk() and high risk()
                                   - recall scores: low risk() and high risk()
                        
6. EasyEnsembleClassifier; - balanced accuracy scores:
                           - precision: low risk() and high risk()
                           - recall scores: low risk() and high risk()
